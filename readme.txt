task 1 and task 2 and task 3_a has been finished

task 3_b didn't finish.

I think task 2 have some problems due to color, I think my algorithm is right, but hard to deal with color.

task 3_b have try my best.

i think the main problem is that I need time to figure out the vertex and normals and index in the Cube.

in the task 1 :

keyPressed() function change

the task 2:

create SCylinder.java under Obejct package

add the object in the VCCW02.java

change the materialAmbient2, materialDiffuse2,materialSpecular2,materialShininess2
